### About ###
Multiplayer Minesweeper with RSocket (Python + JS)

Welcome to the GitHub repository of our cutting-edge project, the first of its kind: a multiplayer Minesweeper game built on the reactive sockets (RSocket) protocol, fully implemented in Python. This implementation aims to provide an interactive and real-time gaming experience where players can compete or collaborate to clear minefields, showcasing the power and efficiency of the RSocket protocol.

### why? 🤔 ###
Initially developed as a live demonstration for the 83rd Moscow-Python meetup in Moscow, Russia, this project aims to showcase the power and utility of the RSocket protocol through an engaging, interactive multiplayer game.
### Key features 🔑 ###
🔄 Real-time synchronization: Leveraging the bidirectional communication capabilities of RSocket, the game board is updated in real-time for all players.
🎲 Multiplayer functionality: Multiple players can connect and interact with the same game session, collaborating or competing with each other.
🌊 Reactive data streams: The game utilizes RSocket's support for reactive data streams to efficiently manage game state updates.
🐍 Python-based implementation: One of the first large-scale uses of RSocket in a Python environment, demonstrating Python's versatility and its capacity for handling modern protocols.
